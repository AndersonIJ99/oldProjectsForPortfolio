        <h2>Project Status: Active</h2>
        <p>This is the beginning of a site that houses reviews of shows and books that I have read. It will be a continual work in progress as I have quite a lot of reviews to write while still continuing to expand what I can review.  Reviews will start as simple summaries with ratings but will eventually have full scale, well thought out reviews that house my opinions as well as possible character breakdowns.  These reviews are my opinion only, and are nothing to be taken personally unless that's your thing.  Once Summer starts I might start watching four series at a time to diversify my watching.  This might slow the overall dedicated finishing process down, but it will clear more shows from the list once I finish a group of them (plus I think this is possibly how I would be watching these anyway if they were ongoing instead of completed already).</p>

        <h3>Ongoing</h3>
        <p>Currently Watching (Series(Season/epsiode #): Black Bullet(1/1) on weekdays and Placeholder(1/1) on weekends</p>
        <a href="planToWatch.html" title="Plan To Watch List">Plan To Watch List</a>
        <p>Notes:<br>The highly convoluted Fate series will probably be watched last due to being so long and hard to follow.  Durarara, Your Lie in April, HunterxHunter, RWBY, Food Wars and SKET Dance are all fairly long series so they will probably be pushed until later as well.  Clannad Afterstory and Clannad the Movie will be watched during the Summer.<br>Update: We are making progress sort of, but the list  increases to both my pleasure and displeasure.</p>
        <p>I'll probably pick back up with the films when I have a large space of free time instead of barely an hour.  I also have to find some of these movies online still.</p>
        <p>Currently Reading (Series(volume #): Arifureta</p>
        <a href="planToRead.html" title="Plan To Read List">Plan To Read List</a>
        <p>Notes:<br>I will probably read Arifureta before the other two before it on the list due to having it as hard copy instead of a digital pdf.  Also since there are more shows to watch versus books to read, I am prioritizing the former to help clear the list.  However, I do read the manga on the list in between parts of my day, so those may be finished and reviewed before the longer novels.</p>
