    <p>Our relationship is a korean webtoon about two best friends, Do Ga-Young and Han Woojin, who almost everyone assumes are dating.  Before becoming friends, Do was often bullied by other students when she wasn't being ignored.  This all changed when Han started trying to hang out with her and be nice.  This sparked their friendship, and it only grew while they were a part of study group.  After high school, they end up going to Some College (yes that's what its called since it must mean something in Korean) together where Do studies film making and editing and Han studies English.  They get separated at the age of twenty when Han leaves to join the military for his mandatory service that is required of all Korean males.  Two years later he comes back and they start being idiots and stuff again like they used to be in high school.  People say that there is no such thing as friendship between a girl and a boy so to prove that they aren't dating, Do makes sure that it doesn't happen.  Even though she tries to distance herself from Han, she starts to get a weird feeling whenever she's around Han (Spoiler: IT'S LOVE!!!).  I'll stop here or I'm going to spoil the whole story without even realizing.  I hope you enjoy the twists, turns, and extreme amount of complications that arise as the story progresses as much as I did.</p>
