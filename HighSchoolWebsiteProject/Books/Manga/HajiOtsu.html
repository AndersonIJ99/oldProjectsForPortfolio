    <p>Our story follows the life of an extremely shy second year high school student, Himari Ashihara.  Himari is perfectly fine around girls, but boys especially the older they get make her feel incredibly anxious.  Himari also attends an all girls school, so trying to overcome this fear through constant exposure is not really an option.  With this is mind, Himari's friend, Shuuko Tokiwa, comes up with a plan to help Himari.  Shuuko happens to be obsessed with manga so her plan is a bit extreme, but it just might be extreme enough to work.  Shuuko suggests that Himari confess her feelings to a guy that she sees everytime on her way to school.  Yae Kashino, Himari's other close friend, is incredibly against the idea because she has a fairly dark impression of guys for no particular reason.  Himari agrees and the next day asks out the first year high school guy, Satoru Kai.  Satoru says yes because he has developed some feelings for Himari already.  As their relationship progresses, Himari begins to feel more and more guilty about hiding the fact that their relationship is really just a test of courage for her.  You'll have to read the rest of this incredibly cute manga to find out what happens next and what new feelings develop between the characters.</p>
