    <p>Note: This summary is basically the same summary I used to describe season two of the show.  This is because the manga follows the same storyline with a few additions and most likely continues after the events of the show.<br>Our story takes place directly after the events of the first season with Umaru just if not more spoiled and poor Taihei still hard at work.  The characters continue to grow closer to each other and take many humorous trips.  Nana Ebina now has feelings for Taihei but is unsure how to express them, Kirie Motoba now believes she is closer to Umaru through being friends with Umaru's lazy alter ego that Umaru has dubbed as her younger sister, Komaru, to hide this side of her from Kirie, and Sylphynford Tachibana is now friends with Umaru because she doesn't realize that UMR is just Umaru's gaming alias.  This crazy bunch never seems to fully understand the truth of their situation but that's sort of what makes this show funny.  However, when a new character enters the fray and knows Umaru's true nature, how will Umaru respond?  Also will Taihei's boss, Kanau Tongou, be able to express her feelings for Taihei?</p>
