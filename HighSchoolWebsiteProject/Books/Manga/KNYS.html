    <p>Our story follows the lives of Kuroki Yuiko, a strict rule abiding second year high school girl, and Tadano Tomoya, a fairly laid-back second year high school guy.  These two are dating, but Kuroki's tsundere nature makes it look less obvious than it is.  Tadano tries his best to help grow the relationship, but is sort of nervous about showing his true feelings all the time, whereas Kuroki appears to almost oppose doing anything that mildly breaks the rules or reveals her true feelings for Tadano.  You'll have to read the rest of the series to discover if this couple grows closer and it what suprising ways.</p>
