    <p>This manga follows a mostly complete version of the Phantom Bullet arc from the Sword Art Online light novels.  However, it appears that a fourth novel was planned to finish out the story but was never released.  All you end up missing is the final scenes that include epic battles from the Bullet of Bullets tournament.</p>
