    <p>Note: This summary is basically the same summary I used to describe season one of the show.  This is because the manga follows the same storyline with a few additions here and there.<br>Our story follows the lives of two siblings.  The older brother, Taihei Doma, works during the day to earn money to purchase food for them and pay the rent for the apartement.  Umaru Doma is Taihei's younger sister who is still in high school.  She is adored by all because of her beauty, academics and athleticism.  Umaru is basically the school idol.  However, this is all a facade because when she gets home she quickly changes into a hamster onsie thing and proceeds to shove whatever junk food she can into her mouth while playing video games, watching videos online, reading manga that she forces her brother to go out and get for her, or making other selfish demands of Taihei.  Umaru gets whatever she wants because if she doesn't she pitches a fit, or acts in a way that causes others around her to make remarks about what a terrible brother Taihei is even though he has done nothing wrong.  This all works because of the facade that she puts on in public.  Taihei has been attempting to train this problem behavior out of her but to no avail.  Will he ever succeed or will Umaru possibly become even more spoiled?  Find out by reading this hilarious manga.</p>
