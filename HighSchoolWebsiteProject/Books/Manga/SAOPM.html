    <p>In short, this series follows the events of the Aincrad arc floor by floor.  The perspectives are from the main protagonist of the main novel series, Kirito, and his companion, Asuna.  This series gives a closer look without timeskips of the journey that began after ten thousand players were locked into virtual death game by the devious genius, Akihiko Kayaba.  Will they beat the game? Well duh of course they will because the main series has already concluded this arc, but it's the events in between that make this series interesting and a total page turner.</p>
