    <p>Note: This summary is basically the same summary I used to describe the show.  This is because the manga follows the same storyline with a few additions and most likely continues after the events of the show.<br>Our story takes place in Japan but it's a little different.  This Japan has instituted laws that have placed a ban on terms that directly state or might infer sexual reproduction.  This was done to try to make Japan the most moral place in the world.  There is even a police force that rounds up the remaining trouble makers and electronic bands on the arms and necks of citizens to make sure that they do not say or even move in a way that may be conceived as dirty.  However, there is one who is considered by the government to be a terrorist.  She goes by Blue Snow and attempts to spread the knowledge that has been restricted from the public in very obscene ways.  However, our main story centers on the life of Tanukichi Okuma, a brand new first year at Japan's most moral school.  However, he comes from Japan's most immoral school, and his father was once even considered a terrorist like Blue Snow until he was arrested.  He is nothing like his father now because he has chosen to follow the path of purity that the second year student council president, Anna Nishikinomiya, has chosen.  He chose to follow this path because as a child after the arrest of his father, everyone avoided him until one day she was the one to first reach out to him.  However, his quest will be immediately trampled upon and completely reversed by the second year student council vice president, Ayame Kajou.  Ayame appears to be a rule abiding student until she reveals her true identity to Tanukichi at a secluded cafe.  What is her true identity and what does it mean for poor Tanukichi's quest to be like and with Anna?</p>
