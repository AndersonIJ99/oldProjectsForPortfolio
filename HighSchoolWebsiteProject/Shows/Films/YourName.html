    <p>The story follows the lives of two contrasting characters who for some reason switch bodies every other day.  These characters are Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl whose duty is to be a shrine maiden in a small village, and Taki Tachibana, a high school guy who lives in the large city of Tokyo.  They realize that what they thought were dreams are actually them switching places because their friends tell them that they were acting strange the previous day.  To set boundaries and make sure that they still maintain their daily lives without actually being in their normal body, they start to leave notes for each other in their diaries on their phones. This starts to go really well for the two, and they start to fall for each other and want to meet in person.  However, this does not last as all of a sudden, they stop switching bodies one day.  What is the cause for this stop?  Will Taki be able to figure it out before he forgets her name, and will they be able to meet in a way that they will recognize each other?<br>Iain's less serious summary: The strings of time get violated so that a happy ending can be secured.</p>
