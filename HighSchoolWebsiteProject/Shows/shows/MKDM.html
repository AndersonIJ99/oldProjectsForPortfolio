    <p>Our story follows the life of Miss Kobayashi, a programmer that works at a stereotypical Japanese office.  Her life proceeds on fairly set schedule.  She works for most of the day and after work gets drinks with a co-worker, Makoto Takiya.  This all changes when one day, she wakes up from a hangover to go to work and sees a  dragon outside her door.  Suddenly the dragon uses magic to transform into a more human form.  The dragon, who introduces herself as Tohru, states that Miss Koabayashi invited her over to her house yesterday night, but Miss Kobayashi doesn't remember any such thing and denies it immediately.  Tohru starts to leave but Miss Kobayashi feels guilty about so quickly rejecting someone who appears to have nowhere to go.  She changes her mind and Tohru decides to become Miss Kobayashi's maid.  Tohru is unaccustomed to this world and thus does many odd things to Miss Kobayashi's dismay.  She teaches Tohru the dos and don'ts of the world she now lives in so people won't find out that she is a dragon.  With Tohru working hard as her maid, Miss Kobayashi's life takes a turn for the best and many of her old bad habits have been replaced with healthier ones thanks to Tohru's diligence.  However, one has to wonder if this will be the last dragon to come to this fairly ordinary world.  Find out what extraordinary event will happen next in Miss Kobayashi's new life.<br>Iain's less serious summary: One dragon is great, especially as a maid, but more is always better.</p>
