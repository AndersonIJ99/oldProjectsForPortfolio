    <p>Our story follows the life of a high school transfer student, Souta Hatate, who has the ability to see flags above people's heads like a dating sim.  He is then able to break, progress, or change their flags.  However, one individual does not have a flag atop her head.  This individual is the foreign princess, Nanami Knight Bladefield, who is infuriated by Souta constantly breaking the friendship flags of those around him so that no one will get close to him.  However, she does not know of Souta's dark past and how it still affects him today.  Souta normally breaks friendship flags until there is one that continually reappears. This flag belongs to Akane Mahougasawa whose goal is to be friends with as many people as possible due losing her only friend when she was younger.   The two girls eventually ask Souta where he lives since they never see where he comes from to go to school.  Souta is uneasy about showing them his abode at first since it is in pretty dangerous condition, but eventually cedes to their constant pleas.  However, a dangerous turn of events awaits the three as they enter the crumbling building.  Watch this show to find out what happens next.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Dating sim + plot the anime.</p>
