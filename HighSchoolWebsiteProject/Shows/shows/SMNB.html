    <p>At one time an empire ruled over the world, but one night it was crushed by a single drag knight clad in black.  This story was to be later called the story of the Black Hero by the New Kingdom that took over the remains of the empire.  All royalty from the fallen empire was either imprisoned, executed, or forced to work to pay back the immense debt they had for just being royalty.  Our story centers around one such individual, the seventh prince Lux Arcadia.  Lux has been permanently assigned to odd jobs that the local citizens request of him to repay both his and his sister's debts to the New Kingdom.  During one of his jobs ends up falling into the bath house at the New Kingdom's drag knight academy.  This academy is an all girls academy, and he lands right on top of a very important individual at the academy.  Lux promptly responds by complimenting the miss' figure instead of trying to explain the situation he has just fallen into, and this causes him a great deal of trouble.  This individual challenges him to a duel to decide whether he attends the academy or is sent to prison on the charge of peeping and sexual harassment.  How will this duel unfold for the weakest undefeated, and where will his odd jobs take him next?<br>Iain's less serious summary: When it's time to be badass and save the girl, it's time to be badass and save the girl.</p>
