    <p>Our story follows the lives of nine children all belonging to the Sakurada family.  This family happens to be the royal family and each of the children possess a magical power that is unique to them.  In order from oldest to youngest they are: Aoi whose ability is Perfect Learning allows her to remember anything she learns forever, Shuu whose ability is Teleportation allows him to teleport himself and anyone or anything that he is touching with his hands anywhere, Kanade whose ability is Heaven's gate allows her to summon anything she can think of as long as she has the money for it in her bank account, Akane whose ability is gravity control allows her to lower the gravity on people and things basically allowing her and others she is touching to fly, Haruka whose ability is Probability Prediction allows him to calculate the probability of any situation he wants, Misaki whose ability is Emotion Division allows her to split herself into her emotions that can help her accomplish tasks with more people at the cost of each person having one of the pieces of her personality, Hikari whose ability is God Hand allows her to grow or shrink things for twenty-four hours, Teru whose ability is Limit Over basically gives him super strength, Shiori whose ability is Object Conversation allows her to talk to objects or things that can't normally speak to humans.  Their father, the King, has decided that must live a more normal life, so they live in a regular home and go to regular schools.  There is only one catch, he has set up thousands of security cameras to watch over his children and make sure they are safe.  Most of the children have gotten used to this.  However, Akane is deathly afraid of being watched by them and exremely shy around other citizens that address her formally.  Since Aoi the eldest child is close to graduating high school, the King has set forth an election process that will be concluded once Aoi graduates.  During the remainder of the year, the children will be competing in a popularity contest of sorts that will ultimately decide the results of the election.  Akane really doesn't like the new found attention that this has gained her family, but her father lets her know that if she were to become king, she could get rid of the cameras and the news channel that publicly broadcasts updates on the family.  This motivates Akane a little, but as she gradually learns of her siblings reasons for becoming king, she becomes unsure of her own, especially since the king receives a lot of attention just by existing.  How will Akane and the rest of the children develop as the election decision draws closer?  What new developments will arise to surprise us as the audience?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Everything comes together in the end because these children are awesome.</p>
