    <p>Our story begins at the start of a new school year for second year middle school student Riko Kurahashi.  On her way to school, the new first years around her are basically fangirling over the elegance and other such attributes of the upperclassmen.  Unbeknownst to them, two middle school boys plan to try to pick up some of these girls with a soccer trick.  One boy kicks the ball directly at two girls while the other boy tries to stop it and thus "save" the girls from this attack.  The "savior" will then introduce himself and his "clumsy" friend.  However, this friend kicks the ball too hard and it looks like the false savior will not make it in time, but suddenly a new savior arises and saves the day.  At blinding speed, Riko has just knocked the ball away from the defenseless first years, and now faces the two mischievious boys who immediately apologize but not before Riko nails one in the gut with the soccer ball.  Riko then gains the name "Wild Kid" without knowing it.  After arriving at the all girls school, the first years continue to fangirl but now over the absolutely perfect student council president.  While walking in the hallway, a teacher asks Riko to deliver some papers to the student council room.  Riko grudgingly agrees and stomps off with the paperwork in hand.  When she reaches the door which has a sign that clearly states to knock before entering, Riko simply opens the door and is greeted with an astonishing sight.  The student council president, Natsuo Maki, is practice kissing with a body pillow that has a man drawn onto it, who Natsuo calls Huggy.  The papers flutter to the ground as Riko's jaw drops, and Natsuo realizes that she has been discovered.  Natsuo is extremely embarrassed and starts to tear up, believing that her career and dignity will be tarnished after the school finds out.  However, Riko promises to not tell anyone because it's kind of normal for girls to want to know what this experience is like even if it's simulated on something that isn't human.  Natsuo is overjoyed and relieved.  Riko then leaves, believing that everything has just been resolved.  However, this is merely the beginning of a crazy journey that explores what love really is.  This journey begins when a sign posted in the hall reveals that Natsuo has made Riko her new student council aide.  Riko wasn't expecting this at all and is a little peaved with this new development, so she goes to confront Natsuo about it.  When confronted, Natsuo explains that since Riko knows her secret that she will aid her in her love research.  Natsuo tells her that she won't have to do any work besides the love research with her.  Riko agrees because she doesn't exactly have anything better to do and is fine with not having to do any real work.  Now this crazy journey has been set fully into motion, but who know what these two will investigate next in their quest to discover love and all that it is.  Also where are all the other student council members?  Does Natsuo really do everything?  Find out by watching this hilarious but touching show.<br>Iain's less serious summary: A surprise encounter turns into hilarious and charming tale of friendship that definitely deserved a second season.</p>
