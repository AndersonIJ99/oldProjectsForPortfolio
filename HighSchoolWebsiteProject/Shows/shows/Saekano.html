    <p>(Epiosde 0 title)Crunchyroll has this episode listed as episode 0 for the series, but it's sort of an OVA that has a lot of fanservice that slightly introduces the concept of the series.  The basic story of the episode follows Tomoya Aki, Megumi Katou, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Utaha Kasumigaoka and Tomoya's cousin Michiru Hyoudou (all members of a doujin circle called Blessing Software) that go out location scouting for their project, a video game.  As Eriri attempts to get Megumi to act out a scenario for the main heroine, Utaha lures Tomoya away and forces him to act out a romantic scenario with her.  Eriri realizes that this is going on eventually and tries to prevent it, but ends up tripping and falling pretty spectacularly.  Utaha goes over to berate Eriri for interrupting while Michiru steals Tomoya away to make her own attempt at a romantic scenario.  This awkwardly fails as Megumi has been watching the entire time.  After the day is over the group all goes to a hot springs place where the activities probably give this episode its name.  Tomoya attemtps to lecture his crew about the game and the goals of their doujin circle, but the heroines aren't really listening.  Instead of listening any further, all of the heroines except for Megumi try to make a move on Tomoya all at once since they are a bit intoxicated.  Somehow Tomoya escapes with Megumi who berates him for being a tactless otaku, and the two watch some fireworks to end off the episode.<br>(Season 1)(Cast: Megumi Katou, Utaha Kasumigaoka, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Tomoya Aki, Michiru Hyoudou, Izumi Hashima, Iori Hashima, Yoshihiko Kamigou, Azusa Satomi, Echika Mizuhara)Our story begins by introducing the passionate otaku and main protagonist, Tomoya Aki, who has a new and extremely big dream.  Tomoya wants to create the best dating sim game that otaku world has ever seen.  This development is inspired by a sudden event in his life that changes him forever.  While riding his bike down a hill, he sees a white beret fly over his head caught by the wind.  He races after it to catch it.  As he reaches the bottom of the hill and retrieves the beret, he turns to see a very majestic girl whose clothing flutters in the wind.  He is entranced by the image of her and the cherry blossoms falling around.  This encounter inspires him to make this girl his main heroine.  He tries to enlist the help of Eriri Spencer Sawamura, the top artist at the school, who happens to be a secret otaku that is very talented at making doujinshi, and Utaha Kasumigaoka,the top student at the school in grades, who also happens to be an otaku that is very talented at writing novels which have sold over five hundred million copies.  Both refuse him for reasons that they won't reveal to him.  However, hope is not lost because Tomoya actually discovers that his main heroine is in his class, but he has been ignoring her all along.  Her name is Megumi Katou, and she couldn't be any more boring.  Megumi speaks in a monotone and her words that should express emotion don't.  Not to mention she has a major presence issue since everyone seems to ignore her.  However, leave it to Tomoya to bring these three girls and more together to form the ultimate game creating circle is this humorous and crazy first season.<br>Iain's less serious summary: A gung ho otaku wants to create a game but his talented artists just want him to decide which one of them he likes the best.<br>(Episode 0 title)Episode 0 of season two, starts off with...<br>(Season 2)<br>Iain's less serious summary: TBD</p>
