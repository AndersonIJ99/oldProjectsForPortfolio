    <p>Our story follows a group of friends that are a part of the literature club at their high school.  All members of the group are girls except for one, Jurai Andou, who also happens to be what is called a chunibyou (one who believes that he has supernatural powers and abilities meant to be used to fight off mythical enemies that threaten the safety of the planet).  The others are: Tomoyo Kanazaki, who dislikes Jurai's acting but has a secret past that no one knows, Katoko Kushikawa, a childhood friend of Jurai who is calm and understanding to some degree of Jurai's antics, Sayumi Takanashi, the smartest of the group who mostly ignores Jurai's chuni business unless it crosses the line, and  Chifuyu Himeki, a grade schooler who comes to the club just to hang out with the others, specifically Jurai.  Most of the time, chunibyous don't actually possess the powers that they claim to have, but this story is different, quite different.  Suddenly, when performing one of his dark incantations, Jurai actually manages to summon a dark flame on his hand and the others in the group develop powers as well.  What will happen now that this group actually has powers, and what will they do with them?  Find out by watching this show.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Chuuni's with actual powers.</p>
