    <p>Our story follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki, a high school senior delinquent who spends most of his time pranking others or skipping school with his friend, Sunohara Youhei.  This all changes when he notices a girl he's never seen before sitting along during lunch.  This girl is Nagisa Furukawa, and she became very ill the previous year and couldn't graduate on time.  Nagisa is doing better this year, but all of her friends have graduated and the drama club that she loved has disbanded.  She wants to start the club up again but is very shy and unsure about how to do so with no connections in school.  Tomoya is touched by this and promises to help her achieve her goal.  Along the way, they have many adventures with other characters and realize their true feelings.  Make sure you have a box of tissues while watching this show even though there are comedic moments throughout.</p>
