    <p>Our story follows the crazy and hilarious adventures of a group of high schoolers.  Tsumiki Miniwa is a short, blue haired partially tsundere girl who sometimes appears or acts very cat-like, and is very much in love with her best friend, Io Otonashi, who is an extremely stoic guy who may be denser than a black hole.  Mayoi Katase is the mad scientist of the bunch and is technologically well versed and a bit of a troublemaker that likes to try unsuccessfully to give hints to Io about Tsumiki's love for him.  Hime Haruno is the completely average member of the group.  She isn't stupid but she's not too bright and she might have an obsession with cute things like the way Tsumiki acts around Io.  Sakaki Inui is basically Mayoi's partner in crime when it comes to being a troublemaker and is Io's best male friend.  These five constantly play around in extremely humorous ways with others along the way, and I'd say it is a much watch.  The group thinks that Tsumiki and Io make a perfect couple, but one has to wonder whether Tsumiki will muster the courage to confess her love to Io or whether Io will notice the extremely obvious hints.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Playing around goes from zero to a million real quick, but everyone seems to have a good time in the end.</p>
