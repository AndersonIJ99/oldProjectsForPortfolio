    <p>Our story takes place in a world where every so often violent space quakes suddenly emerge, destroying a large area of land.  The first occurrence of this now phenomenom took the lives of almost 150 million people.  However, the world now has an alarm system set up as well as bunkers that protect people and buildings from most of the future harm.  Our story begins when the main protagonist, Shido Itsuka, runs to "save" his sister during a violent space quake only to realize that she is not the one who needs to be saved.  The space quake goes off damaging the surrounding area in a sphere shape.  Shido is mostly unharmed, but he notices that at the center of the quake is a girl clad in purple armor with a large glowing sword.  At once a squad of girls with high tech jet packs and weaponry swoops over the buildings, opening fire on the girl at the center of the quake.  This squad is only a fraction of an elite group called the AST's (Anti-Spirit Team).  Their goal is take out spirits like the one at the center of this quake so that they don't cause any more damage.  They are yet to be successful.  However, Shido feels that the girl is sad and deserves a place in this world.  His little sister, Kotori Itsuka, agrees as the head of a secret organization founded on sealing these spirits powers instead of killing them.  The only way to do this though is by having Shido go on a date with them and successfully win their affection.  Now that it's up to Shido to save this girl will he even be able to get close enough, or will the AST's make their first confirmed kill?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Shido gets all the girls even the ones that don't know it yet.</p>
