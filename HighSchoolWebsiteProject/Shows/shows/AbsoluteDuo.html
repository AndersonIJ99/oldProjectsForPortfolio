    <p>Our story is set in world with many secrets.  A world where there is a very ideal high school that handles meals and board but at a price that the students do not know of.  The goal of the school is for the students with powers that were awakened by injected serums to form partnerships called duos and level up enough to reach the level of absolute duo.  The staff of the school will use any means to reach this goal, but even they have their enemies.  However, our story focuses on the lives of two avengers who have pasts that involve losing loved ones.  Tooru Kokonoe and Julie Sigtuna, a foreigner, are on a quest for revenge.  However, only one of them truly has a weapon.  While Julie is armed with dual short swords, Tooru has a small shield on his hand (not much good for revenge if you ask me).  On the way to the opening ceremony, Tooru meets a nice girl, Imari Nagakura, who notices him staring at the beautiful Julie.  They walk to the ceremony together and unfortunately sit next to each other.  To start the ceremony, the head master, Sakuya Tsukumo, tells them that they must duel with their seat partner to decide who truly gets to enter the school.  This is unexpected and some students try to protest but eventually they all concede to fight each other.  Tooru starts on the defensive because he doesn't want to kick Imari out of the school, but she leaves him no choice when she challenges his motive for being there.  Those that that did not win their duels are asked to leave, and only those that won remain.  Of the remaining our main squad of students forms consisting of: Tooru, Julie, Miyabi Hotaka, a girl who wields a large lance, Tomoe Tachibana, a girl who wields a chain with spear heads at the tips, Aoi Torasaki, a boy who wields a hand glaive, and Ryuutarou Tatsuno, a boy who wields a large battle axe.   Upon entering the classroom, Julie chooses to sit next to Tooru who is called an irregular because a shield isn't exactly a weapon.  Tooru notices that she is fixing him with constant stare, and he tries to start up a conversation.  However, whenever he turns towards her, she turns away abruptly.  He gives up on this and decides to talk to his friend Aoi who is sitting in another seat relatively close to him.  Just then their homeroom teacher, Rito Tsukimi, who is dressed like a bunny enters and tells them that their seat partner will be their temporary duo.  Rito also lets them know that they will be spending their time with their duo including sleeping quarters.  This earns Tooru a lot of stares because he is the only student who is paired with a student of the opposite gender, being Julie.  He tries to clear up the misconceptions that are already generating in the rest of his classmates' minds but is unable to do so.  How will the story progress now with Imari out of the picture and now Julie as a temporary duo that has put odd thoughts into the class' heads.  Will Tooru and Julie get their revenge, and what new relationships await them. (Note: All of the students are in their first year of high school)</p>
