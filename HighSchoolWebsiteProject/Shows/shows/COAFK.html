    <p>This story, centers around people that have the potential ability to summon weapons or armor due to having a certain magic potential from birth.  These people are called "blazers" and learn how to harness and improve their ability at famous knight schools.  All of this should ensure that those that who are gifted are better than those that are not, but one man, Ikki Kurogane, defies this with his hard work and dedication.  As an F-rank Knight, Ikki will only be able to graduate through the special condition that he win the festival that the best of the best from each school compete at near the end of the year.  When Ikki gets a new roommate in the form of a foreign princess, Stella Vermillion, things start to take off after he defeats her in a duel.  This is surprising, but a sign of what is to come because she is an A-rank Knight that should not be able to be scratched by an F-rank Knight.  From here on the story explodes into action and maybe a little romance (teehee), but you'll have to read to find out what happens next in the story about hard work, dedication, a conflict of ideals.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Defying limits still looks really cool with swords, especially with that samurai vibe.</p>
