    <p>Our story begins, with first year high school student, Eita Kidou, whose parents have divorced and left him to fend for himself with his aunt.  Eita declares himself as anti-romance and pledges to get the medical school scholarship reccomendation from his high school that only those with the best of the best grades can get.  He studies diligently everyday, keeping himself fairly isolated except for having dinner with his childhood friend, Harusaki Chiwa.  His plan sounds sure to be a success until the most attractive girl at the school, Masuzu Natsukawa, discovers a dark part of his past, and uses it to blackmail him into becoming her personal love confession shield aka a fake boyfriend.  Mayhem ensues as feelings fly between multiple females at the school.  This anime is definitely deserving of a second season, but probably won't get one.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Anti-romance romance</p>
