    <p>Our story follows the life of Makabe Masamune, a first year high school student, who has undergone a major transformation from a fat and rudely mannered child to a physically attractive and kind teen.  He now lives with his aunt or grandmother or something, Kinue Hayase, who tries to make him meals but they are way to high in calories and fat for Makabe to eat and still maintain his physical appearance.  Kinue has a daughter, Chinatsu Hayase, who has a majorly strong metabolism and happily devours whatever Kinue serves while calling her adopted brother a narcicist.  In his past, his feelings of affection were once rejected by a cruel young girl, Aki Adagaki, who hasn't changed one bit since their childhood together, and its time for some revenge.  Upon arriving at his new high school, Aki has just ruined the reputation and social standing of yet another boy, continuing her status as the cruel princess at school.  At school she is surrounded by girls who act as her servants, one in particular whose family has been serving the Adagaki's for years.  This girl, Yoshino Koiwai, remembers Makabe's embarassing past as the so-called "pig's foot".  When he meets with her to discover how she found out, he finally remembers her and decides to share his plans of revenge with her.  Surprisingly, Yoshino agrees to help Makabe with his plans but only if he does things her way.  This begins a crazy turn of events that even I wasn't able to expect, so you'll have to keep watching to find out what happens next and where the story finally ends.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Boy attempts to get revenge on girl who rejected him in the past by becoming good looking and getting her attracted to him until she asks him out only to refuse her in the end.  Other characters enter and the plan gets twisted as usual.</p>
