    <p>In this world, some people have special powers that aid them in taking out creatures called shades that mess with the normal ongoings of the human world.  These shades come in all shapes and sizes and each has a level of danger associated with it.  Our story begins, when high school junior, Akihito Kanbara, stumbles upon a freshman girl who looks like she is about to jump off the top of the school to her death.  Upon trying to stop her, she stabs him with a blade made of blood.  This would be the end of our story, but Akihito doesn't die.  Akihito is a half shade and from this he has gained immortality.  The freshman, Mirai Kuriyama, doesn't know this and is surprised when he kindly askes her to remove the blade from his body.  The story continues with the introduction the literature club that Akihito is a part of with two other members, Mitsuki and Hiroomi Nase.  Watch the story of these strange individuals to see what secrets they will begin to uncover, but beware of close and present danger that resides in one of these friends known as Beyond the Boundary.</p>
