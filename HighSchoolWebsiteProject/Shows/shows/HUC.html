    <p>(Season 1)Our story follows the lives of two siblings.  The older brother, Taihei Doma, works during the day to earn money to purchase food for them and pay the rent for the apartement.  Umaru Doma is Taihei's younger sister who is still in high school.  She is adored by all because of her beauty, academics and athleticism.  Umaru is basically the school idol.  However, this is all a facade because when she gets home she quickly changes into a hamster onsie thing and proceeds to shove whatever junk food she can into her mouth while playing video games, watching videos online, reading manga that she forces her brother to go out and get for her, or making other selfish demands of Taihei.  Umaru gets whatever she wants because if she doesn't she pitches a fit, or acts in a way that causes others around her to make remarks about what a terrible brother Taihei is even though he has done nothing wrong.  This all works because of the facade that she puts on in public.  Taihei has been attempting to train this problem behavior out of her but to no avail.  Will he ever succeed or will Umaru possibly become even more spoiled?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Lazy gamer gets away with everything because onii-chan is extremely nice.<br>(Season 2)Our story takes place directly after the events of the first season with Umaru just if not more spoiled and poor Taihei still hard at work.  The characters continue to grow closer to each other and take many humorous trips.  Nana Ebina now has feelings for Taihei but is unsure how to express them, Kirie Motoba now believes she is closer to Umaru through being friends with Umaru's lazy alter ego that Umaru has dubbed as her younger sister, Komaru, to hide this side of her from Kirie, and Sylphynford Tachibana is now friends with Umaru because she doesn't realize that UMR is just Umaru's gaming alias.  This crazy bunch never seems to fully understand the truth of their situation but that's sort of what makes this show funny.  However, when a new character enters the fray and knows Umaru's true nature, how will Umaru respond?  Also will Taihei's boss, Kanau Tongou, be able to express her feelings for Taihei?  Watch the show to gain the answers to these questions.  Unfortunately this season does not wrap up the series as a whole so we'll just have to wait for a possible future season.</p>
