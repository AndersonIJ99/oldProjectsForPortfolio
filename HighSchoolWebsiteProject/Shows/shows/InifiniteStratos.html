    <p>(Season 1)Our story takes place in a world where robotic exosuits called Infinite Stratos or IS for short are immensely powerful weapons so strong that an international treaty bans their use as a military asset.  The only ones who can pilot them are females, and this has since led to the dominance that females have in society.  However, one male has been able to control an IS.  Ichika Orimura, a fifteen year old, who is starting at the world renowned IS academy that teaches students how to properly control an IS and get better at doing so for competitions.  The only problem is that Ichika is the only guy at the school and way behind in his IS studies.  This provides a very uncomfortable situation for our protagonist as many of the background girls spend their time gossipping about him while others like Houki Shinonono, Ichika's childhood friend who he has been reunited with after six years, and Cecilia Alcott, a foreign elite from Great Britain who feels superior to everyone especially Ichika, act coldly towards Ichika before finding feelings for him.  Ichika is not very bright and is fairly behind in his studies, so he asks Houki to tutor him about IS, but she sort of just practices kendo with him after class because she wants to spend time with him.  This is not just because Ichika is very out of practice, but actually more because she likes Ichika but is unable to tell him like most tsunderes.  She began tutoring him because he begged her after foolishly accepting the challenge of Cecilia to a duel to see who will be the class representative.  How will the duel progress and how will Ichika's life become even more uncomfortable?  Also what dangers will arise in the relatively calm school environment?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Ichika is denser than a black hole, but all the girls still love him.  The real question is, whose feeling will he return the most since with basic harems the main character seems to never decide on one by the end.<br>(OVA 1)This OVA is split into to two parts.  The first starts with all the girls in love with Ichika showing up at his house during a break from school.  Each had the idea of being along with Ichika, but their hopes have been dashed by each other.  Ichika's older sister also arrives but decides to leave, feeling that she is making the situation even tenser because the others view her as competition even though she is related to Ichika direcly.  Each of the girls cooks something for him to eat except for Cecilia who continues the running joke that Great Britain's cooking and food sucks.  The second part of the OVA, follows Houki who goes to help her grandmother at a summer festival.  Ichika shows up and the grandmother lets Houki go around the festival with him in a yukata.  This is relatively romantic until the younger sister of one of Ichika's guy friends shows up.  She just so happens to also be in love with him, but she ditched her brother to find Ichika, and eventually has to go stop him from embarassing her by calling out for her.  The OVA ends with Houki and Ichika standing close watching the fireworks.  Houki attempts to confess her feelings for Ichika but the noise of fireworks drowns out her voice, and Ichika fails to hear her honestly confess since he seems to be more entranced by the fireworks than the hot babe next to him.(baka)<br>Iain's less serious summary: Please let this ship set sail.<br>(Cast: Charlotte Dunois, Laura Bodewig, Houki Shinonono, Ichika Orimura, Cecilia Alcott, Lingyin Huang, Chifuyu Orimura, Tabane Shinonono, Honne Nohotoke, Maya Yamada, Tatenashi Sarashiki)(Season 2)Our story begins in a dream of Ichika's that faintly resembles the one in which he was gifted the power he needed to defeat the strong IS at the end of the first season.  Ichika sees what he thinks is Chifuyu in an IS and approaches her.  However, a darkness spreads out from her and covers her body before she grabs Ichika's throat and states that she will kill him.  Ichika awakes from the dream and it's the last day of summer vacation before the new school year, and Ichika being as dense as ever ends up inviting all of the girls that like him to a summer event that you're only supposed to invite one girl to.  They still end up having a good time, but it's a cometition between the girls as usual.  A dark-suited girl who once again resembles Chifuyu is also seen invading a top security building where she easily defeats the guards.  She reveals that she intends to steal the IS stored there, but what does this IS have that her incredibly powerful one doesn't.  We are also introduced to a new character, Tatenashi Sarashiki, who appears to be very mysterious, saying only a few words before the premier episode ends.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Ichika is as weak as ever, but he still is in the right place at the right time to protect his friends.  Also even more girls love Ichika now.<br>(OVA 2)For a forty-five minute OVA, not too much happens, but the little that does is still hilarious and mildly cool.  Ichika is away at the moment getting his IS repaired while the other girls are at school pretending they don't miss him.  However, this will not be a peaceful joke episode as the school comes under attack.  Chifuyu informs the girls that the school is being hacked and that they need to enter the IS virtual reality to stop the problem virtually before it reaches the mainframe.  Each girl enters the virtual world, but none are prepared for the events that will follow.  Each ends up getting trapped in their own fantasy with their ideal Ichika.  Charlotte is Ichika's dirty maid that he will be married to.  Laura is Ichika's husband that for some reason gave out cards that allow him to ask for whatever favor he wants to be granted.  Ling is Ichika's girlfriend back in middle school, but he wants to do the deed more or less against her will.  Cecilia is the head of her family and has Ichika as her butler who for some reason has a day each week where he gets to wash her body however he wants.  Lastly, Houki is to be married to the strong Ichika she remembers from the past.  While all of this is going on in the virtual world, the real world isn't any less hectic.  American special forces have come to try to steal the illegal IS cores that the school has secretly withheld.  This will not be so easy.  Tatenashi very easily dispatches the ground forces while Chifuyu in only body armor battles it out with an IS.  Chifuyu of course isn't able to fully defeat the IS beacuse all she has are six swords, but she is able to lead it into a trap where Yamada is waiting with an IS armed with four miniguns.  Tatenashi gets slightly distracted and gets shot by a downed soldier and calls out for Ichika.  Ichika has some mighty fine intuition when it comes to saving his friends, so he comes to her rescue only for her to tell him that he also needs to rescue the others in virtual reality.  With the help of Kanzashi he is able to infiltrate the others dreams and take out the fake Ichikas.  This frees the girls but of course all of them were about to get it on, so they're more or less clothed but not enough to not be embarrassed about being seen by the real Ichika.  Ichika has a little trouble waking up from virtual reality and when he does he is the infirmary next to none other than Tatenashi who happens to be undressed and exposed.  He looks away in embarrassment as she quickly dresses.  He steals another glance back because she has begun talking to him, but she is now in the same bed as him.  He turns away again.  Tatenashi thanks him for coming to save her when she called and for saving the others from their lewd fantasies.  The OVA ends with Chifuyu confronting the AI sent by Tanabe to invade the mainframe and steal information on her personal IS.<br>Iain's less serious summary: These girls are more dirty than they let on, and Ichika takes the blame as usual.  We can only hope for a season three that will wrap up the series.</p>
