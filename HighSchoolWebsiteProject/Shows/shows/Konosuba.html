    <p>If you are looking for an anti-cliche comedy then this is the show for you.  Kazuma, an eighteen year old shut-in neet, dies saving a girl about to be hit by a truck on his way home from buying a new game that he is interested in.  However, after death he is greeted by a goddess, Aqua, who will grant him one way to be reborn or move on in his afterlife.  He can either go to heaven, be reborn as a new person in the world he died in, or go to a fantasy world with a unique super power.  Of course, he chooses the third option being the gamer he is, but his choice of power is surprising, and you'll have to watch the show to find out how Kazuma's adeventure begins.<br>Iain's less serious summary: The anti-cliche cliche anime that's absolutely hilarious.</p>
