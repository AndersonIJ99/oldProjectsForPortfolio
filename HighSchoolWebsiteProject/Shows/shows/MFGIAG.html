    <p>Junichi Hashiba, a second year high school student, wants for nothing more than to have a girlfriend.  He has his eyes set on a smart and modest girl in his class named Yui Kashii, but he feels like he isn't good enough and will never be in her league even though they interact fairly well.  Junichi has decent looks, but his group of extremely perverted friends: Shinpei Sakamoto, the planner of the group, Keigo Ishida, the bold one who puts the plan into action, and Minoru Kobayakawa, the one into younger girls (empahasis on the younger part); are not popular and tend to creep or gross others out.  They feel that he should go for something higher than Yui, a real gal.  This gal happens to be the most popular one at the school, Yukana Yame.  His friends set him up by planting a love letter with his signature forged on it in Yukana's shoe locker.  Junichi is shocked and not sure what to do, but Shinpei already planned for this and simply says to prostrate himself before her and beg.  Junichi is highly opposed to the idea of groveling, but what will he do when he has to meet face to face at the back of the school with a gal, who the morning of caught him trying to cover up his friends dirty material?</p>
