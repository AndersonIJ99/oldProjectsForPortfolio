    <p>Itsuki Hashima, a light novelist who lives in an apartement by himself, is very talented at what he does, but he has an obsession with little sisters and fantasies that involve them with the main hero.  His most popular series at the time even features them getting together with the main hero who happens to be an older brother.  However, Itsuki doesn't have a little sister of his own and thus his obsession continues.  He does have a very feminine little brother, Chihiro Hashima, who comes to his apartement everyday to cook meals for him and check to see that he is doing alright after leaving his home over a disagreement with his father.  Itsuki also has three friends that often come to his apartement to socialize over drinks and food.  The youngest by two years but most forward of the friends is Nayuta Kani, who Itsuki often refers to as Kanikou because of her cat-like nature and appearance.  Nayuta is madly in love with Itsuki, but he has yet to accept her feelings.  The two others are Miyako Shirakawa, a college girl that is friends with Nayuta and met Itsuki in college before he dropped out, and Haruto Fuwa, a fellow light novelist of Itsuki who writes fairly differently so that he will insure the best sales.  Find out how the relationships between these characters will develop along with others that come along the way in this hilarious and suspenseful romcom.</p>
