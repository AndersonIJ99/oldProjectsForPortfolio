    <p>Our story centers around Hachiman Hikigaya ,a cinic in his second year of high school, who believes that youth is lie and an excuse that people use for mistakes and reckless behavior.  Hikigaya is forced into a club that's purpose is to serve and help the students of the school with problems that they are having due to the guidance counselor, Shizuka Hiratsuka, who is displeased with his outlook in one of his opinionated papers about his life in high school.  The only club member, Yukino Yukinoshita, who is very much the ideal intellectual with an icy personality towards others is assigned to help Hikigaya with his problem and then compete with him to see who can help more people with their outlook.  Loser has to do whatever the winner says.  Read the story to find out how twists turns change these three and others they encounter in this unconventional romcom.  This anime is definitely deserving of at least a couple wrap up OVAs or a third season at the most.</p>
