    <p>Taking place directly after the events of the first season one of Date A Live, Date A Live II once again follows Shido on his quest to save the lives of Spirits before they can be harmed by AST's or the even more fearsome DEM (Deus Ex Machina).  The spirits are only getting stronger and much, much more resistant to human intervention, so will our hero be able to seal them all and will it be in time?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Shido continues to get all the girls and shows them that he is the man they deserve.</p>
