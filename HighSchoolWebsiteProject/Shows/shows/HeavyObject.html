    <p>Our story takes place in our world but in a version where the United Nations has broken up along with countless other countries.  War that involves flesh and blood soldiers is uncommon because the powers that exist in the world instead use large war machines called objects that wield immense military might.  If an object gets defeated, the war ends and the two sides stop fighting.  With this almost game of chess version of war, one has to wonder what happens if an enemy object disregards the losing side's surrender.  Well you'll find out because our story follows the lives of two soldiers initially stationed at an arctic base as part of an object maintenance group.  Qwenthur Barbotage and Havia Winchell are basically two grunts that always seem to get in trouble with their commanding officer Frolaytia Capistrano.  The object stationed at their base is called the Baby Magnum and is a mere tier 1 model which can easily be outclassed by stronger versions or ones that are more suited to a specific terrain.  The pilot of the Baby Magnum is an elite, Milinda Brantini, who the two guys call Princess.  During one skirmish with another higher class object the Baby Magnum is defeated, so Frolaytia puts up the white flag.  However, the other object called the Water Strider disregards this and starts to eviscerate the soldiers at the base.  As a last resort, Milinda activates her tracking beacon to draw the object away from the soldiers.  Frolaytia orders an evacuation, but Qwenthur and eventually Havia decide to go rescue the princess because they feel it is their duty since she has been protecting everyone at the base with her life while piloting the object.  Will they be able to save the Princess, and how will they defeat the object as just two regular soldiers stuck in the middle of an unending series of mini wars.  Find out by watching this exciting and hilarious show.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Two idiots save the day every single time it needs saving.</p>
