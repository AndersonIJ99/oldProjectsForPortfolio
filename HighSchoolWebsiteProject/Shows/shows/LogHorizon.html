    <p>Our story begins when a large amount of gamers get trapped inside a database that is running the game ElderTale.  The game is a fantasy game and players of all skill levels and classes have no way of getting back to the real world.  The main protagonist and planner, Shiro, leads a group of friends and eventually more as they explore what has changed in the world they watched through their computer monitors.  As they adventure throughout the land they are reunited with past friends as well as new ones, while they discover that a lot has changed and no one has any idea how to get back to the real world.  NPCs or later called People of the Land and the text on gear also starts to play out differently than in the game as well, and this creates problems and opportunities for our adventurers.  Join them as they explore Akihabara and beyond.</p>
