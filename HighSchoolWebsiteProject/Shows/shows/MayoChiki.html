    <p>(Cast: Subaru Konoe, Kanade Suzutsuki, Kinjirou Sakamachi, Masamune Usami, Nakuru Narumi, Kureha Sakamachi, Ichigo Saotome, Yamato Kurose, Nagare Konoe, Jirou Sakamachi)Our life follows the second year high schooler Kinjirou Sakamachi.  Born into a pro wrestler's family, Kinjirou has a lot of experience with being the punching bag of his mom and younger sister, Kureha Sakamachi.  With this in play, Kinjirou has developed gynophobia where his nose begins to bleed whenever he gets just barely touched by a girl.  Anything more than that and he is at risk of passing out.  His father, Jirou Sakamachi, passed away when he was younger, but he left him with the goal to become strong enough that he can protect others.  Kinjirou has taken this to heart and definitely shows this off during the series.  His life is going pretty painfully since he gets woken up by his sister's various suplex moves, and his friends are starting to think he's gay since he doesn't associate with girls.  You may be thinking this life doesn't sound too great, but it's about to enter a completely new sequence of twists and turns that put Kinjirou through much more than he's ever experienced before.  At Kinjirou's school there is a girl who is admired by all as the school's idol because she is beautiful and rich as she is the principal's daughter.  Her name is Kanade Suzutsuki and she has a butler,Subaru Konoe, that attends school with her attending to her every need.  Subaru also has some frightening fan clubs that have developed for him.  However, Kinjirou's crazier life begins when a girl is about to brush something off of Kinjirou's shoulder, but he runs away fearing that his phobia will act up.  During his escape he actually ends up bumping into another girl, and his nose spurts as he quickly apologizes before continuing his escape.  Kinjirou ends up in the restroom so he can clean himself up.  While there he decides he needs to use to the restroom, so he opens the first what he assumes to be vacant stall.  However, the stall wasn't vacant.  Who does Kinjirou see in the stall before him, and how does this single event cause his life to get even crazier than it already is?  You'll have to watch the series to find out.<br>Iain's less serious summary: The main protagonists ends up with a whole bunch of girls trying to cure his phobia, but each really just wants to be his partner for life.</p>
