    <p>Our story follows the life of Sorata Kanda, a second year high school student, who lives in the Sakurasou dorm.  Everyone else that lives there is a genius, but has some social aspect about them that makes it impossible for them to live in the regular student dorms (Basically this is the problem children dorm).  Sorata is not a genius by any stretch, so why is he there?  Well it's because he found a stray cat that he couldn't help but take in.  This was against the normal dorm's rules, and after a small grace period he was sent to Sakurasou where very few regulations exist.  Sorata has since taken in more poor stray cats and can't seem to find caretakers for any (Not that he's really looking).  The geniuses at Sakurasou include: Misaki Kamiigusa, a high school senior who is a professional anime creator who has her heart set on Jin Mitaka,  Jin Mitaka, a student the same year as Misaki who is a professional storyline writer who for some reason has three different mistresses that he alternates between, and Ryuunosuke Akasaka, a student the same year as Sorata who is a professional programmer who created a chat AI called Maid-chan who assists with replying to his emails.  Life is as rough as usual until it gets rougher for Sorata when a new student arrives at Sakurasou.  This new student is Shiina Mashiro, a student the same year as Sorata who is a professional artist who came to Japan to become a manga artist, and she can't seem to take care of any of her basic needs like food, clothes, and even basic hygiene.  It is up to Sorata to take on this Mashiro Duty and thus his crazy life gets even crazier.  How will the story progress from here, and what exciting adventures await this odd group?</p>
