    <p>Our story follows the lives of the 35th Test Platoon at the antimagic academy whose score pales in comparison to those of other platoons.  This may partially be due to the fact that the main protagonist, Takeru Kusanagi, uses a samurai style blade in a world populated with guns and long range fights with witches that use magic.  His companions are a tech genius, Ikaruga Suganami, and a distracted sniper, Usagi Saionji.  This team is on the brink of failing until a member is forcibly added from the higher ups due to problems that she is causing there.  Ouka Ootiri, an esteemed witch hunter with a large grudge, comes to the rescue of the team only to find herself being rescued by Kusanagi in her time of need.  However, an extremely powerful necromancer known as Haunted summons a dangerous creature to attack the academy, and the 35th Test Platoon is there on the double to save their home.  All of the combat members go down and the situation is looking bleak.  How will Kusanagi slash his way out of this one?  Watch the show to find out?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Samurai style protagonist in a world of guns looks amazing.</p>
