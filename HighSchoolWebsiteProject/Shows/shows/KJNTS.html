    <p>Our story follows a cute middle school love story.  Nishikata and Takagi are in their third year of middle school.  Nishikata is constantly getting teased by Takagi, and really wants to get her back.  However, each time he tries it backfires and he gets in trouble with his really strict English teacher.  Just when Nishikata is about to burst from frustration each time, Takagi shows him her affectionate side which immediately transfers all of Nishikata's frustration into embarrassment because he actually likes Takagi.  Nishikata has no hope at getting back at Takagi since she basically can read his mind, or at least understand his thought process completely.  Takagi also likes Nishikata, but Nishikata isn't the greatest at taking obvious hints.  Also neither of the two really want to openly express the feeling they feel for each other.  So I guess you'll just have to watch this hilarious back and forth to see where it heads next.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Overthinking things doesn't seem to help most of the time especially for our protagonist.</p>
