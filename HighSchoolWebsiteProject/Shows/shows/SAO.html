    <p>(Aincrad Arc)With the emergence of brilliant new technology in the virtual reality sector of gaming, people are able to travel to new worlds without moving a muscle.  This technology called the nervegear uses microwaves to transmit signals to and from the brain to control an avatar in an online world, and was developed by a programming genius, Akihiko Kayaba, along with a game to pioneer a new genre of games,VRMMORPGs.  This game was Sword Art Online (hence the series title) and is a fantasy game that features all the stuff you would expect except for magic.  This may be a game from the outside, but it is not something you play, especially when the log out button is removed and if you die in the game, you die in real life.  Will the protagonists, a shut-in Kazuto Kirigaya, and the newbie, Asuna Yuuki, be able to beat this game before time runs out?<br>(Fairy Dance Arc)With the recent end of the death game and the return of many players to the real world all appears to be ready to return to normal.  However, there is one problem, not all the players came back and one in particular is near and dear to our main protagonist's heart.  For one of the few times in his life, Kazuto is unsure of what to do because Asuna and others are still stuck on SAO servers.  But where?  Upon one of his usual visits to her at the hospital, he meets her father again and a new man, Nobuyuki Sugou.  Asuna's father leaves shortly after but Nobuyuki stays behind and shares a few words with Kazuto.  He declares that he will be joining the Yuuki family which will basically forcefully marry Asuna to him.  He even adds injury to insult by inviting Kazuto to the wedding taking place in eight days in her hospital room.  When Kazuto returns home he is depressed and disheartened because he feels like he is going to lose Asuna to the executive that now controls the servers that are keeping her "alive".  However, some comforting words from his sister, Suguha Kirigaya, and a picture from Agil, Kazuto or should I now say Kirito is now back on track to save the day.  A blurry screenshot of the top of a tree in a new VRMMO called Alfheim Online shows a figure that has strikingly similar features to Asuna, and thus begins Kirito's next quest.  What adversaries will Kirito meet this time, and are there friends closer than he thinks?   Find out if he saves the girl and of course everyone else in the exciting second half of Sword Art Online!</p>
