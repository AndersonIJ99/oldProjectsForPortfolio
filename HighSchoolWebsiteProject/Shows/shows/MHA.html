    <p>Our story is set in a world where eighty percent of the population has supernatural powers called quirks.  Students in this day and age train academically until they reach high school where they start to focus on developing their quirks to become pro heroes that go and save the day. Sadly, our protagonist, Izuku "Deku" Midoriya, was born with no quirk and is shunned because of this fact by many, even his childhood "friend", Katsuki Bakugo.  However, when Deku meets his super hero idol, All Might, he ends up convincing him to train him through a series of events.  Watch as Deku begins his journey to become a pro hero.<br>Iain's less serious summary: From no quirk to the best quirk.  P.S. sorry for the spoiler.  If this even counts.</p>
