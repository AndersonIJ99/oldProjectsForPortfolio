    <p>Our story begins on Earth, but the setting is a bit different.  People have been forced to live underground to avoid the gunmen that patrol the surface, annihilating humans on the surface with superior weaponry and crushing those below with large earthquakes caused by them crashing into the surface.  The two main protagonists are two boys living in one of the underground "sanctuaries".  Simon, a digger that helps expand the town he lives in, and Kamina, a rambunctious teen that dreams of escaping to the surface to chase after his father, are rudely awakened when a gunmen crashes through their town's roof, and are forced to fight for their lives with newly acquired help from one of Simon's digging discoveries and that of a surface dweller girl's assistance.  Together the three escape to the surface only to find that it is not as great as Kamina had described to Simon.  Where will their journey go from here?<br>Iain's less serious summary: All things are spirals, and spirals are everthing.  If this doesn't make sense it's because two opposite spirals make a double helix.</p>
