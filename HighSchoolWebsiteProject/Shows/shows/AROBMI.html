    <p>The Alzano Empire is home to one of the most distinguished magic schools in the world: the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy. Here, ambitious young students undergo training to become competent magicians. Sistine Fibel, a stern noble girl who for whatever reason resembles a cat, and her bright-eyed best friend Rumia Tingel attend the Academy, determined to cultivate their magical skills.  Sistine specifically hopes to one day reach the floating sky castle that her Grandfather, who passed away before reaching it, did so much research on.  However, their world is thrown for a loop when their favorite teacher suddenly retires and the enigmatic Glenn Radars replaces him upon recommendation from the most dinstinuished professor at the school, Celica Arfonia. His lazy and indifferent attitude toward life and magic quickly puts him at odds with his class. What's more, nefarious forces hidden within the empire's walls start to become active, and Sistine, Rumia, and Glenn find themselves caught up in their schemes.  Our story follows Sistine, who is now at odds with Glenn over a dispute over the reason for magic and the sky castle; Rumia, who is haunted by a troubled past; and Glenn, who may be more than meets the eye but definitely needs to shape up a bit first. Though completely different on the surface, they are inexplicably bound together by a thread of fate.  Will these dangerous forces that are lurking just around the next corner be subdued?  Find out by watching this series that wraps up fairly well.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Magic has some really dark roots in this world's politics, but it's time for the Mage of Justice to return and this time he's kicking ass for the right people.</p>
