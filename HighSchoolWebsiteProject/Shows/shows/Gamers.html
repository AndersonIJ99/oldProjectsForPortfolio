    <p>Do you want misunderstandings and people dragging their feet with uncertainty? Then this is the show for you.  Gamers! doesn't exactly feature too much gaming, but does use it as the background for this hilarious romantic comedy/slice of life.  Keita Amano, a second year high school gaming shut-in, who is very shy suddenly is wrenched out of his comfort zone when the most popular girl his age, Karen Tendou, invites him to the gaming club she has created at the school.  Amano accepts and goes to the club only to find it filled with hardcore gamers that care a little too much about being the best of the best in their favorite games.  Amano who prefers enjoying his games over hardcore rankings decides to decline Tendou's offer to join the club.  This only serves to begin Amano's crazy journey as Tendou has already fallen for him whether she realizes it or not yet.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Misunderstandings the anime.</p>
