    <p>A sequence of humorous shorts featuring a girl, Yuuko Konagai, and her three cats' adventures.  The three cats: Maa, a mischievious munchkin who loves to explore, Rou, a level headed Russian Blue, and Shi, a laid back Singapura cat, all are extremely cute and lovable.  Yuuko desires to have friends like her popular classmate, Azumu Shiratori, but is fairly antisocial and tends to just hang out with her cats in her free time.  Her cats want to help her but are unsure of what they can do.  Will an unexpected encounter set these characters onto the path they want?  Find out by watching this short twelve episode series.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Friendship and Cats is just plain adorable.</p>
