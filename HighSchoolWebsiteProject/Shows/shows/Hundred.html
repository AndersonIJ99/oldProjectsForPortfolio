    <p>Our story follows the life of Hayato Kisaragi, a teenage guy who has the highest compatibility of any person with the powerful devices used by a group called slayers.  These devices are called hundreds, and take the form of a weapon usually that the user can use to kill off creatures called savages that come from outerspace and try to cause distruction and chaos.  The slayers reside on a floating fortress called the Little Garden that houses a prestigious military academy.  Hayato agrees to attend the academy so that his younger sister, Karen Kisaragi, can receive treatment for her weakened state.  He attracts the attention of many female peers throughout his journey to improve his skill so that he can protect everyone from the savages and any evil thing beyond them.  You'll have to watch this series to see what awaits Hayato and his companions on his journey.<br>Iain's less serious summary: The badass swordsman gets all the girls, but actually decides on one in the end.</p>
