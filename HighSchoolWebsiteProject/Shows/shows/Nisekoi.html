    <p>(Season 1)Our story follows the life of Raku Ichijo, a first year high school student who is the sole heir to the Yakuza in Japan.  His life seems to be going fairly well other than his inability to confess his feelings toward his classmate, Kosaki Onodera.  This all changes while walking to school one day when a beautiful blonde haired girl flawlessly leaps over a fence while on her way to school.  However, she ends up kneeing Raku in the face which of course practically decapacitates him and causes him to lose his precious pendant.  This pendant was given to him by a girl that he made a promise with ten years ago to complete whatever that promise was if they were ever reunited.  Upon arriving at his class, the teacher announces that they have a new student who happens to be part American.  This student happens to be the girl who kneed Raku in the face.  Her name is Chitoge Kirisaki and the two immediately get into an argument, which will be a constant for the show.  Throughout the day they bicker especially since they are seated next to each other.  Raku evens forces Chitoge to help him look for the pendant that she knocked out of his grasp on that fateful day.  While looking for the pendant, Raku explains its importance to Chitoge and Kosaki who came to help as well.  He tells them about the promise, and that the girl will have a key to unlock the locket which will reveal what the promise was.  This makes Kosaki nervous because she also has something like that in her past, and a key to boot (Later in the series, Chitoge discovers an old diary of hers that describes a similar promise and a key which could also possibly unlock the locket).  Eventually Chitoge finds it, but in return she demands that he never talk to her again.  This will not last because their parents have other ideas.  To stop a war between the Yakuzas and an American gang called Beehive, their parents force them to become a couple in the eyes of their lackeys so that they will stop fighting.  Can the events get any more twisted in this story?  Well you'll have to find out by watching this hilarious show.<br>Iain's less serious summary: Every girl has a promise and a key from ten years ago, and ends up falling for Raku.<br>(Season 2)The story picks up directly after the events of season one, with Raku still stuck between the affections of the various heroines.  The relationships between the various characters get a little more fleshed out as new characters get added to the mix.  These characters are Paula McCoy, who is Seishirou Tsugumi's self proclaimed rival, and Haru Onodera, Kosaki's younger sister who hates Raku because of the rumors she has heard about him.  If I were to spoil too much more of the story which is basically made up of various adventures that the characters go on, you wouldn't want to watch the series, so here we go with some hinting rhetorical questions.  Whose affection for Raku will win out?  Will it be the kind but incredibly shy Kosaki Onodera, the outwardly prickly but internally affectionate (tsundere) Chitoge Kirisaki, or the extremely forward Marika Tachibana who gets embarrassed when the tables are turned?  How much will Ruri Miyamoto set up Kosaki with Raku, and how will Haru try to break them apart?  Also what will happen when Raku's friend, Shuu Maiko, reveals his first love to Raku, and who will it be?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Possible antagonists become positive supporting characters because Raku finally says things that won't get him punched, slapped, kicked, punted, etc.  This usually occurs after he stops being so dense and unobservant.<br>(OVA 1)In the first half, Ruri loses her glasses and attempts to help dense Raku find out that Kosaki likes him.  However, Raku still doesn't get it when Ruri is almost directly leading him, so she is about to just directly say it when Shuu prevents her.  Shuu tells Ruri that he just wants what is best for his friend which to him is letting Raku find out for himself.  Eventually, they do find Ruri's glasses but that is of little importance when the goal was for Raku to realize the feelings of Kosaki.  The second half occurs on New Years Eve.  The group has agreed to help out at a shrine before the ringing of the New Year's bell.  The girls are all dressed as shrine maidens, and all appears to be well.  However, they learn from the owner of the shrine that Raku is being haunted by bad spirits set onto him by the boys in his class that are jealous of him having all the cutest girls to himself.  These spirits are giving him terrible luck in all different ways, so the owner tells the girls different ways to lift this curse.  The girls are not allowed to tell Raku he is cursed because that will make the curse permanent.  Hilarity ensues as the girls each try to covertly lift the curse in a different way suggested by the owner.  None are ultimately successful, but luckily for them on their final attempt they actually end up chasing Raku into the perfect position for the first method the owner brought up that was shot down immediately.  This method was to sandwich Raku between the New Year's bell and large wooden trunk used to ring it right when it is about to be rung.  While the curse has been removed from Raku, it does not remove the pain of having his head smashed between the bell and the trunk.<br>(OVA 2)In the first half, Raku notices that Marika has been leaving fairly quickly after school ends for the day.  He mentions this to Chitoge, but Chitoge hasn't noticed and wants to go get some fries from a restaurant.  Raku agrees to go, and the two go to a local family restaurant.  Upon entering they are suprised to be greeted by Marika in a waitress uniform.  Marika assumes that Raku came to see her at work and gladly seats the two of them.  She takes their orders and the craziness begins.  Raku starts to hear lots of crashes and shattering noises as well as the cries of the owner.  Raku goes to investigate and discovers that Marika is terrible at her job and is dropping plates and other dishes everywhere.  However, the owner tells him that he can't fire her because she is the only employee who is always cheery and working hard consistently.  He even says that some customers just come to see her too.  Now it's time to crank things up a notch, as the Yakuzas, the Beehive gang, and the first unit of the police special forces enter the restaurant.  Raku and Chitoge try to calm the rival gangs but when the police enter the fray it's all over.  The three start to fight and all hope looks lost, but Marika actually comes to the rescue and chucks all the members out of the restaurant.  The owner is now truly indebted to Marika.  Raku, Chitoge, and Marika all walk home, but Raku asks Marika why she is working because he knows that she doesn't like to do things like that.  Marika answers that she is saving money for their marriage and house together.  Rakua and Chitoge react as you would expect and that basically wraps up the first half.  The second half takes place on New Year's day.  Chitoge is supposed to be coming over to see Raku and eat at his house.  However, she surprises him by bringing the rest of the group of their friends all dressed in kimonos.  Even the Yakuzas were in on the surprise and have prepared extra food.  They all enjoy a nice meal together, but Chitoge wants something sweet, so Raku goes to search for something in the kitchen.  The only problem is that Chitoge doesn't like Japanese sweets, but luckily for him he finds some Whiskey Bon Bon chocolates.  Everyone except for Raku has some of the chocolate, and he doses off for a bit.  Upon waking, he realizes that everyone else has left the room.  Suddenly Chitoge appears but she is drunk from eating just one chocolate, but Raku manages to fight her advances off.  Shuu thinks this is cute but right after he tells Raku so, he is punted through several walls by Marika who is also under the influence.  Raku persuades her to stop beating up Shuu, and then Seishirou shows up appearing to be no better off than the others.  Raku manages to stop her from kissing him, and finds Ruri who while drunk is calculating the demise of Japan because of economic and birth rate declines.  However, Kosaki appears to have it the worst as she is feeling quite hot and it trying to remove her kimono while making advances on Raku.  Raku tries to go get the group some cold water to help cure them of this phase, but Chitoge summons Seishirou to pin him.  The scene ends and the following scene opens with Raku waking up but deciding to go back to sleep after not remembering anything from the previous day.  All the girls except for Ruri are in a circle, and flinch when Raku speaks before going back to sleep.  The episode ends with Chitoge stating that nothing happened there that night, and the others agreeing.<br>Iain's less serious summary:  Something definitely happened but who am I to say that it was lewd *wink wink nudge nudge.<br>(OVA 3)One public bath and one hot springs scene all sealed into a single fanservice episode.<br>(OVA 4)The first half, reveals a dream scenario where Raku arrives home from his civil service job on his wedding annivesary.  Each dream involves Raku and one of the girl that loves him.  However, each family seems to have a dog resembling Chitoge that dislikes Raku.  Also when it is finally the dream involving Chitoge, she actually has the head of a dog and has very dog-like habits.  The other wierd thing is that Raku and the girl involved wake up both remembering the dream.  The dreams all end before the married couple gets into the naughty bit of the scenario.  The second half continues the Magical Girl story from season two.  The girls all end up defeating the evil Doctor Maiko, but the embarrassment doesn't end there.  The episode ends by teasing the introduction of Haru as a new magical girl, but obviously there isn't another OVA to watch.(Maybe season 3 if that ever comes out)</p>
