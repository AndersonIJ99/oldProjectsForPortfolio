    <p>Our story follows the life of interesting individual, Yuu Otosaka, who has the ability to take control of someone's body directly by seeing them.  When he does so, his own body goes limp but he sees what the victim sees and this is where what he does with his power comes into play.  Yuu uses his ability to see the answers he needs for exams and memorize them, so that he can get perfect scores which allow him to get into the best schools.  He also uses this ability to influence events to his liking, but when he's found out by others that possess powers, his time of play is over and his world has been completely fipped on its head.  The two that discover him, Nao Tomori and Joujirou Takajou, force him to transfer to a school full of others like him that possess powers during their adolescence due to the mysterious effects of a comet's particles.  They also force him to help the student council with its activities which involve tracking down more like him that are using their powers to put themselves above average humans.  What will happen next in Yuu's life now that it appears that it is completely out of his control?</p>
