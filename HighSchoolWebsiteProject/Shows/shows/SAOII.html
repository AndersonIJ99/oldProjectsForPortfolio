    <p>After the seed was released onto the internet, games and servers rapidly sprouted up across the globe causing the slow and progressive recovery of the VRMMO genre of games.  One such game that arose is Gun Gale Online.  In stark contrast to the other fantasy titles, it features the only pro players at the time.  This seems harmless at first but when the threat of death online arises again, it is up to Kirito to save the day...again.  This season also features two ALO arcs, Excalibur and Mother's Rosary, that show off the entire original cast of characters and more as they continue their adventures in the vast land of ALO.</p>
