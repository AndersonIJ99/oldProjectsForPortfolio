    <p>Karen Kohiruimaki always felt out of place in the real world.  Due to her extreme height, she found it hard to make friends with other girls her age.  Everything changes when she is introduced to the VRMMORPG genre of games and Gun Gale Online.  In GGO, Karen is free to play the cute, chibi avatar of her dreams.  Before trying GGO, Karen tested countless other games but found that she kept ending up just as tall as she was in the real world.  Karen goes by the alias LLENN in game and dresses her avatar in an all pink body suit.  She learns the basics of the game from a frightening female drill instructor AI.  Karen isn't really good with any of the guns except for the submachineguns which fortunately enough are perfect for allowing her to utilize her full agility while still providing some decent fire power.  In her early days of GGO, she mostly stuck with using a small laser rifle to hunt low level monsters while running from the stronger ones.  As she gradually became more accustomed to the game, she decided to read strategy guides to help her overcome the stronger monsters.  However things would not remain this reasonably peaceful.  During one hunting excursion, when she was waiting for a trap she set for monsters to go off, a group of players approached her.  She remembered the drill instructor's lesson about players in the wild, so she took action when she heard the explosion of her trap going off.  Karen quickly killed of the team while being fairly well camoflauged against the sand and extremely fast. By engaging in this type of play known as player killing or PKing, she earned the name Pink Devil for herself.  As her fame grew, some even tried to get her back but were unsuccessful.  After one battle, Karen thinks she is in the safe, but she finds herself face to face with the barrel of a pistol.  However, this pistol isn't going to shoot at her.  The holder is the rich gun collector, Pitohui, who wants to befriend Karen.  Karen decides to become Pitohui's friend because she doesn't have any at the moment.  Pitohui teaches Karen more about the game and shows her a shop that has some very rare weaponry.  The brand new P90 submachinegun catches Karen's eye, and from then on, P-chan(Karen's name for the small submachinegun) and the alias LLENN are inseparable.  Karen and Pitohui make an agreement that if Karen is able to defeat Pitohui with P-chan then Pitohui will actually meet Karen in real life, so they can become more than just in-game friends.  You'll have to watch the show to find out if Karen succeeds and see what other excitement awaits Karen in her online adventure.<br>Iain's less serious summary: When being tall gives you anxiety, just find a virtual game where you can play as a cute chibi that kills people, virtually of course.</p>
