    <p>Our story follows the new chapter of Haruka Shinozaki's life in his second year of high school that begins after he professes his love to the beautiful, but secretly mentally tainted, Akiho Kosaka.  Crazy misunderstandings and countless innuendos make this series extremely humorous to those that understand the jokes and aren't offended by the content.  Just make sure you're old enough to be viewing 17+ content.  Also if you don't like crude jokes and innuendos, I would not recommend that you watch this show as you may be offended easily.</p>
