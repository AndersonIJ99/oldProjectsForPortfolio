    <p>Masamune Izumi, a first year high schooler, has been a light novelist since he was in the fifth grade, but he has never met the artist who draws such erotic art for his novels.  His artist didn't even show up to the signing party for the final novel in his most successful series.  Masamune also has a little sister, Sagiri Izumi, who is not related by blood, living in an apartement with him and his aunt who never seems to be home.  Sagiri never comes out of her room and Masamune just leaves meals for her at her door before he heads off to school.  Sagiri has been heavily into art ever since she sent a small drawing to an anonymous internet novelist who said that it was great.  One day Masamune tunes into a live stream hosted by his artist Eromanga Sensei who is clad in a mask and green jacket.  However, when the artist forgets to actually end the stream, and he notices some interior features of his own apartement he comes to a sudden realisation right as his artist is about to get undressed.  Will he get to the room fast enough to let Eromanga Sensei know to end the live stream?  Is the artist's identity who he thinks it is?  Find out by watching this show.</p>
