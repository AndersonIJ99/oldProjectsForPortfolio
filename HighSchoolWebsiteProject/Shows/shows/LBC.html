    <p>Our story follows the lives of a group of humorous campers that are in their first and second years of high school.  This humorous adventure begins with the reticent Rin Shima who likes to camp solo and is extremely experienced in this aspect.  However, this all changes when during one trip to a campsite near Mt. Fuji, she encounters a kind but fairly ditzy girl her age.  This girl is Nadeshiko Kagamihara and she wanted to go camping as well, but she got tired after biking to the camp site.  After arriving, Nadeshiko fell asleep and didn't wake up until it was dark out.  This frightened her a lot, but luckily Rin was there to lend a helping hand until Nadeshiko's older sister came to get her.  As the school year begins, Rin is still as reserved as ever, but Nadeshiko has been inspired by Rin and seeks out the Outdoor Activities Club that is said to go camping.  How will this comfy story continue, and what craziness will arise even with the calmness that camping usually is?<br>Iain's less serious summary: Feel the comfort take hold of you as you watch this humorous set of camping adventures.</p>
