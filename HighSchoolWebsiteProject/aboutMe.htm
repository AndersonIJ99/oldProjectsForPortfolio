        <h3>The Man Behind the Text</h3>
        <p>Hey it's that dude who writes all the stuff on this site.  Well let's just briefly go over some of my interests as they relate to this site and take a brief look at the rest of my life near the end.  I used to watch a lot of action and I guess you could call some of them battle anime (Pokemon, Gurren Lagann, Digimon, Gundam, etc.) that had some mild romance on the side, but now I almost purely watch romantic comedies or pure romances with some action or mecha in the mix to spice things up or because they look cool.  I mainly read light novels or manga to continue anime series that show no signs of getting second seasons or OVAs because like many I want to know what happens next.  Right now I am a senior in high school, and soon I'll be graduating.  Once I do, this site's productiveness may tank a bit as I get adjusted to college, but I'll be sure to keep adding and finishing up this site as life goes on.</p>
